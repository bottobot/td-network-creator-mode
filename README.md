# ðŸŽ¨ TD Network Creator Mode

A specialized mode for [Roo-Cline](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Cline) that creates TouchDesigner networks using the TD MCP Server exclusively for accurate operator information.

## Overview

The TD Network Creator mode is designed to generate TouchDesigner networks through Python scripts that can be executed in textport. It ensures accuracy by consulting the TD MCP Server for all TouchDesigner-related details, never relying on assumptions or training data.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Resolution Selection**: Always starts by asking about output resolution (4K, 1080p, 720p, or custom)
- **Interactive Clarification**: Asks clarifying questions with a "continue without prompting" option
- **TD MCP Server Integration**: Exclusively uses TD MCP Server for all operator details
- **Line-by-Line Validation**: Validates every generated line against TD MCP Server data
- **Python Script Generation**: Creates clean, executable Python scripts for textport

### Advanced Features

#### Performance Optimization
- Network bottleneck analysis
- Cook dependency optimization
- GPU vs CPU operator recommendations
- Resolution and bit depth optimization
- Instancing opportunities identification

#### Template System
- Common network patterns (feedback loops, audio reactive, particle systems)
- Modular, reusable components
- Proper container organization
- Standardized input/output structures

#### Visual Documentation
- **Automatic Mermaid Diagrams**: Generates flow diagrams for every network
- **Multiple Export Formats**: PDF, SVG, PNG support
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Shows operators, connections, hierarchies, and data flow
- **Conversion Scripts**: Includes scripts for diagram export

#### Network Validation
- Circular dependency checking
- Parameter range and type validation
- Resolution consistency verification
- Color space validation
- Deprecated operator warnings

#### Multiple Output Formats
- Main production script
- Simplified learning version
- Extended version with optimizations
- Debug version with logging
- Modular version for integration

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Roo-Cline](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Cline) installed
2. Copy the mode configuration to your workspace or global settings
3. Install the [TD MCP Server](https://github.com/your-username/TD-MCP) if not already installed

### Option 1: Workspace Installation
Create a `.roomodes` file in your workspace root:

```yaml
customModes:
  - slug: td-network-creator
    # ... (see td-network-creator.yaml for full configuration)
```

### Option 2: Global Installation
Add to your global custom modes file at:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\VSCodium\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\custom_modes.yaml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/custom_modes.yaml`
- Linux: `~/.config/VSCodium/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/custom_modes.yaml`

## Usage

1. Switch to TD Network Creator mode in Roo-Cline
2. Describe the TouchDesigner network you want to create
3. Select your desired output resolution
4. Answer any clarifying questions (or choose to continue without prompting)
5. Receive your generated Python script and visual documentation

### Example Workflow

```
User: Create a particle system with audio reactivity
Bot: What resolution should the output be?
     1. 4K (3840x2160)
     2. 1080p (1920x1080)
     3. 720p (1280x720)
     4. Custom (you'll specify)
User: 2
Bot: What audio input source would you like to use?
     1. Microphone input
     2. Audio file playback
     3. System audio capture
     4. Continue without prompting me again, use your best judgment
...
```

## Output Example

The mode generates multiple files:

### 1. Python Script (`particle_audio_network.py`)
```python
# TouchDesigner Network: Audio Reactive Particle System
# Resolution: 1920x1080
# Generated by TD Network Creator Mode

# Clear existing network (optional)
# op('/').deleteAllChildren()

# Create audio input
audio_in = op('/').create(audiodevin, 'audio_input')
audio_in.par.device = 0  # Default audio device

# Create audio analysis
audio_analyze = op('/').create(analyzeChop, 'audio_analyzer')
audio_analyze.par.function = 'rms'
audio_in.outputConnectors[0].connect(audio_analyze.inputConnectors[0])

# ... (rest of network creation)
```

### 2. Mermaid Diagram (`particle_audio_network.mmd`)
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Audio Input"
        A[Audio Device In CHOP] --> B[Analyze CHOP]
        B --> C[Math CHOP - normalize]
    end
    
    subgraph "Particle Generation"
        D[SOP to CHOP] --> E[Particle SOP]
        C --> E
    end
    
    subgraph "Rendering"
        E --> F[Geometry COMP]
        F --> G[Render TOP]
        G --> H[Null TOP - output]
    end
```

### 3. Conversion Scripts
- `convert_to_pdf.bat` / `convert_to_pdf.sh`
- `convert_to_svg.bat` / `convert_to_svg.sh`

## Requirements

- TouchDesigner (099 or later recommended)
- TD MCP Server installed and running
- Node.js (for Mermaid diagram conversion)
- Optional: mermaid-cli for direct conversion
